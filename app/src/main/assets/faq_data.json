    "answer": "Effective management involves a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods. Remove infected plant parts promptly and avoid overhead irrigation to reduce leaf wetness. Improve air circulation through plant spacing and pruning. Apply preventive fungicides such as those containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper-based compounds when environmental conditions are favorable for disease development. Use crop rotation and resistant varieties when available, and always rotate fungicide modes of action to prevent resistance buildup.",

    "answer": "Prevention begins with field sanitation, including the complete removal of plant debris after harvest. Implement crop rotation with non-host plants to reduce inoculum buildup in the soil. Use drip irrigation instead of overhead watering and apply mulch to reduce soil splashing. Select disease-free transplants and avoid working in fields when foliage is wet. Monitor the crop regularly and apply fungicides preventively in high-risk periods. Keeping plants healthy and stress-free is key to preventing severe outbreaks of Target Spot.",

    "tag": "Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_CurlVirus",
    "answer": "Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV) is a viral disease that severely affects tomato production worldwide. It is transmitted by the silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), which acts as a vector by feeding on infected plants and spreading the virus to healthy ones. The virus cannot spread through direct contact between plants or seeds it relies entirely on the whitefly for transmission. Once a plant is infected, it cannot be cured, making early prevention and vector control critical.",
    "question": "What is Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV) and how is it transmitted?",
    "context": "cause"
  },
  {
    "tag": "Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_CurlVirus",
    "answer": "Typical symptoms of TYLCV include yellowing and upward curling of young leaves, stunted growth, and a general lack of vigor. The internodes become shortened, giving the plant a bushy appearance. Flower drop is common, leading to significantly reduced fruit set and yield. In severe cases, plants may appear almost entirely yellow and fail to produce any marketable fruit, particularly if infection occurs early in the growing season.",

    "context": "symptom"
  },
  {
    "tag": "Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_CurlVirus",
    "answer": "TYLCV can cause up to 100% yield loss in highly susceptible cultivars, especially if infection occurs during early vegetative stages. Infected plants produce fewer and smaller fruits, and often drop flowers before fruit set. Even if some fruit develops, it may be delayed, uneven in size, and unmarketable due to poor plant health. Yield loss depends on factors such as the timing of infection, whitefly pressure, and the resistance level of the cultivar.",
    "question": "How can TYLCV affect tomato yield and quality?",
    "context": "follow_up"
  },
  {
    "tag": "Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_CurlVirus",
    "answer": "Since TYLCV is incurable once a plant is infected, management focuses on preventing infection and controlling whiteflies. Use TYLCV-resistant or tolerant tomato varieties whenever possible. Employ physical barriers like insect netting, yellow sticky traps, and row covers to reduce whitefly populations. Avoid planting near older tomato fields or weeds that may harbor whiteflies. Apply insecticides strategically to control whitefly vectors especially during early plant growth stages. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, including regular monitoring and biological control, are essential for sustainable control.",

  {
    "tag": "Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_CurlVirus",
    "answer": "Yes, TYLCV prevention begins with a proactive, integrated approach. Choose certified virus-free seedlings and plant resistant cultivars suited for your region. Practice crop rotation and remove crop residues and nearby host weeds to eliminate potential virus reservoirs. Time your planting to avoid peak whitefly activity, and maintain field hygiene by cleaning tools and equipment. Use biological controls such as Encarsia formosa (a parasitic wasp) to help reduce whitefly populations naturally. Early action and continuous monitoring are key to keeping TYLCV under control season after season.",
